# Which testing software to use?

That seems to come down to jasmine or mocha

## Jasmine - Pivital Labs

**PROS**

- popular project
- all in the box; testRunner, testDoubles
- full AngularJS support


**CONS**

- lack of flexibility re: other libs


## Mocha - Vision Media

**PROS**

- popular:  and written by a guru programmer
- flexible: you add the assertion and test-double plugins


**CONS**

- late support for AngularJS but it's there


## Conclusion

- both strong, choose either based on your needs.
- Mocha does async testing better
